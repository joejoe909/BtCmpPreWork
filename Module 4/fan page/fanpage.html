    <h2>Bio</h2>

    <p>During the 1980s, each of the future members of Tool moved to Los Angeles. Both Paul D'Amour and Adam Jones wanted to
    enter the film industry, while Maynard James Keenan found employment remodeling pet stores after having studied visual
    arts in Michigan.[2] Danny Carey and Keenan performed for Green Jellÿ,[2] and Carey played with Carole King and Pigmy
    Love Circus.[3]
    
    Keenan and Jones met through a mutual friend in 1989.[4] After Keenan played a tape recording for Jones of his previous
    band project, Jones was so impressed by his voice that he eventually talked his friend into forming their own band.[4]
    They started jamming together and were on the lookout for a drummer and a bass player. Carey happened to live above
    Keenan and was introduced to Jones by Tom Morello, an old high school friend of Jones and former member of Electric
    Sheep.[5] Carey began playing in their sessions because he "felt kinda sorry for them," as other invited musicians were
    not showing up.[6] Tool's lineup was completed when a friend of Jones introduced them to bassist D'Amour.[7] Early on,
    the band fabricated the story that they formed because of the pseudophilosophy "lachrymology".[8]
